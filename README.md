Sprint 1:
Contributions:
Waleed Naveed - 
- Jira Task - Added research for CSS, HTML , and Research.
	- refernce: https://bitbucket.org/cs3398s23gorns/gamedevswe/branch/JUM-18-research-react-css-and-html
	_ Wasnt able to do other tasks, due to the way the code was written for the base game. 
	
	
Jess Stevenson: "created the flask webpage and the orginization of our pages as well as creating a basic scoring system for the game once added."

    Rertospective:
        The first few days went very well, but i quickly fell off my amount of time working on the program each day.
        I plan to better spread out my time with teh project so that i can stay up to date with the rest of my team and get as much done as possible in the sprint.

+-Jira Task: HTML5 audio tag
+	-As i was going i made a file of some websites I got info from but I went to a lot of places to find how to embed and design the audio tags. 
+	I also found a simple mp3 player to play the music. I made audio tags for each movement that are ready to be put into the game. But I was 
+	able to complete most of my tasks.
+	-tried to add pause menu. I got an external pause link to work but its the same as the main menu and would not let you continue where paused

+	-all mp3 sounds
+	https://bitbucket.org/cs3398s23gorns/gamedevswe/commits/branch/mp3_Audio
+	-ui in game menu i also added the ui for the music player in the start menu with differnet music

+Retrospective Dillon Hughes:
+	-I could have gotten the audio tags and research done quicker and have been able to commit all the code for the game to get a better demo. 
+	I also think we all could have met up once a week and just sat down and put our ideas together so we can all start contributing equally but 
+	on different areas of the game. I think I did all of my work but I could have made the ui's better and put in a little extra time designing
+	the music uis and helping with other tasks.
+	


Next Steps:
Waleed - Finish adding backgrounds and character, compartmentalize game.

Jess Stevenson: change the score from the frame count to points, which will be a mix if collectibles, enemies killed, and distance traveled.

Dillon Hughes-+	
-My next steps for the project is completing all of the audio tags. I need to talk to my team to try and find every possible 
+	movement or action in the game and assosiate it with a well thought of audio tag.
+	-I want to impliment a custom ui for the music volume and for all player movement to have a game volume slider.
+	-I also was going to start helping get the movements down along with the projectiles and enemys.
+	-To just get better at communicating so this project can start picking up so we can get a good product by the end of the last sprint.
